# What?

This is my **frogger** implementation using OpenGL shaders, C++ and Qt (mainly for UI only). I have to say this is not the complete game nor a optimised game, however it shows well the concepts behind this kind of game development using C++/OpenGL and Qt.

# Why?

To learn the basics behind the graphical pipeline which powers OpenGL and how to extract the power of GPU.

The game doesn't have any complex shaders so it is quite simple to understand what is going on.

# How?

Frogger-opengl was built using QtCreator, C++ and OpenGL. The shaders were written in GLSL and are very simplistic by nature.

Checkout the code that handles movement to understand better the use of matrix and vectors for GPU computation.
